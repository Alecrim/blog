I’m a creative, independent and passionate person. I'm also a creative, independent and passionate computer programmer since the 1980s.

Going a little further: I am an experienced Systems Analyst, Systems Architect, Software Architect and Software Engineer with over thirty years of experience.

During this time I've been working as manager and leader of teams and projects. I also taught classes in programming logic, data structures, object-oriented programming and relational databases, and gave lectures on various subjects.

In 2010 I returned again to develop applications for Apple platforms (my passion since before 1984) from where I have focused my career.

Today I’m still an Apple platforms specialist, creating and developing apps, libraries and frameworks for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS and toastOS.

Usually, I write my own apps, libraries and frameworks under the name **Alecrim** which is how the rosemary plant is called in [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language). *(“You know, it’s time now to learn Portuguese, it’s time now to learn what I know and what I don’t know...”)*
